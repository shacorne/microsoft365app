# Office 365 Node.js Connect sample using Microsoft Graph

Connecting to Office 365 is the first step every app must take to start working with Office 365 services and data. This sample shows how to connect and then call one endpoint through the Microsoft Graph API (previously called Office 365 unified API), and uses the Office Fabric UI to create an Office 365 experience.

Try out the [Get started with Office 365 APIs](http://dev.office.com/getting-started/office365apis?platform=option-node#setup) page which simplifies registration so you can get this sample running faster.

## Prerequisites

To use the Office 365 Node.js Connect sample, you need the following:
* An Office 365 account. You can sign up for [an Office 365 Developer subscription](https://portal.office.com/Signup/Signup.aspx?OfferId=6881A1CB-F4EB-4db3-9F18-388898DAF510&DL=DEVELOPERPACK&ali=1#0) that includes the resources that you need to start building Office 365 apps.

     > **Note:**
     If you already have a subscription, the previous link sends you to a page with the message *Sorry, you can’t add that to your current account*. In that case use an account from your current Office 365 subscription.<br /><br />
     If you are already signed-in to Office 365, the Sign-in button in the previous link shows the message *Sorry, we can't process your request*. In that case sign-out from Office 365 in that same page and sign-in again.
* A Microsoft Azure tenant to register your application. Azure Active Directory (AD) provides identity services that applications use for authentication and authorization. A trial subscription can be acquired here: [Microsoft Azure](https://account.windowsazure.com/SignUp).

     > **Important:**
     You also need to make sure your Azure subscription is bound to your Office 365 tenant. To do this, see the Active Directory team's blog post, [Creating and Managing Multiple Windows Azure Active Directories](http://blogs.technet.com/b/ad/archive/2013/11/08/creating-and-managing-multiple-windows-azure-active-directories.aspx). The section **Adding a new directory** will explain how to do this. You can also see [Set up your Office 365 development environment](https://msdn.microsoft.com/office/office365/howto/setup-development-environment#bk_CreateAzureSubscription) and the section **Associate your Office 365 account with Azure AD to create and manage apps** for more information.
* A client ID, client secret, and redirect URI values of an application registered in Azure. This sample application must be granted the **Send mail as signed-in user** permission for **Microsoft Graph**. [Add a web application in Azure](https://msdn.microsoft.com/office/office365/HowTo/add-common-consent-manually#bk_RegisterWebApp) and [grant proper permissions](https://github.com/OfficeDev/O365-Nodejs-Microsoft-Graph-Connect/wiki/Grant-permissions-to-the-Connect-application-in-Azure) to it.

     > **Note:**
     During the app registration process, make sure to specify **http://localhost:3000/login** as the **Sign-on URL**.
     
* Consult the section [Configure and run the app](#configure-and-run-the-app) for platform specific prerequisites.

## Configure and run the app

1. Update [```authHelper.js/client_id```](authHelper.js#L7) with your application's client id
2. Update [```authHelper.js/client_secret```](authHelper.js#L8) with your application's client secret
3. Update [```authHelper.js/redirect_uri```](authHelper.js#L9) with your application's redirect uri

Prerequisites
* [```node```](https://nodejs.org/en/) - JavaScript runtime built on Chrome V8
* [```npm```](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node) - Node Package Manager

To run the app, type the following into your command line:

1. ```npm install``` - install application dependencies
2. ```npm start``` - starts the application server


## Launch the app in your browser
Once the application server has been started, open your favorite web browser to ```http://localhost:3000```
